Its success lies in its breakthrough compared with the previous Hong Kong police films. This film does not rely solely on hero image like other Hong Kong police and gangster films. Instead, it infects the audience with its exquisite plot and neat scene editing, and uses the ups and downs of the plot to show the contradictions and conflicts between the characters. In addition, this film shows the complex relationship between police and robbers, but it\'s not limited to sheer cunning and falsehood, especially the tragic death of Chen Yongren in the end. Therefore, "Infernal Affairs" stands out of the general police films which justice will eventually defeat evil. The director’s diligence is also manifested in the application of many other film techniques, such as the playback where Liu Jianming watched Chen Yongren leave the police school, using their misplaced starting point in their lives to promote the development of the plot.

Whether it is the analysis of the bullet material or the choice between the good and the bad, it always makes people feel that he process and the final result are completely separated, which weakens the coherence of the story. And the long narration of the film in the first half of the film will put the fans into a state of sleepiness. Although the climax appears at the end, it is too close to the end. The completely inconsistent story rhythm is still hard to be called wonderful. But it is undeniable that in the handling of the ending, it is still beyond the expectations of ordinary people. A shot in a gun, life or death, this kind of plot could only be filmed by Hong Kong people.

The best part of the film is Bingbing Fan's hair. In one of the scenes, Bingbing Fan looks up and cries, with her silky hair spreading out in the air, which looks like a shampoo advertisement. Guo Jingming makes a wise choice to use both real people and CG effects, so that the audience can enjoy both the good-looking cast and the action stunts which cannot be done in fantasy films. The film looks like a large transition animation for a single-player game. But it avoids the awkwardness of live-action performance in Ice Fantasy and distracts the audience's attention on the slightly embarrassing acting of a group of fresh actors and actresses. In addition, the soundtrack of fight scenes matches the film's grand background, making it a bit of a Japanese animation."]

The best part of the film is Bingbing Fan's hair. In one of the scenes, Bingbing Fan looks up and cries, with her silky hair spreading out in the air, which looks like a shampoo advertisement. Guo Jingming makes a wise choice to use both real people and CG effects, so that the audience can enjoy both the good-looking cast and the action stunts which cannot be done in fantasy films. The film looks like a large transition animation for a single-player game. But it avoids the awkwardness of live-action performance in Ice Fantasy and distracts the audience's attention on the slightly embarrassing acting of a group of fresh actors and actresses. In addition, the soundtrack of fight scenes matches the film's grand background, making it a bit of a Japanese animation."]
